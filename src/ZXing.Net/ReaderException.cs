		// rejecting it. This involves a lot of overhead and memory allocation, and affects both performance
		// and latency on continuous scan clients. In the future, we should change all the decoders not to
		// throw exceptions for routine events, like not finding a barcode on a given row. Instead, we
		// should return error codes back to the callers, and simply delete this class. In the mean time, I
		// have altered this class to be as lightweight as possible, by ignoring the exception string, and
		// by disabling the generation of stack traces, which is especially time consuming. These are just
		// temporary measures, pending the big cleanup.
